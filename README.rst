FAQ
---

Why build Plock on top of Buildout? 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Plock is a work around for ``pip install Plone`` which technically works, but requires a lengthy requirements.txt file and is missing features provided by Buildout e.g. "instance" creation.

Why support pip? 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To advance the state of Plone such that Buildout can be used, but not required.

Why make Buildout optional? 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To market Plone to Python programmers who are generally more familiar with pip than Buildout.

Why the name Plock?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Plock is a `single by the band Plone <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlLzsF61n-8>`_. It is also the name of a `city in Poland <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C5%82ock>`_.

.. [1] Sort of. Plock installs and runs Buildout for you.
